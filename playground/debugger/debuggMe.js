//* the Objective of this playground is to get used to running a function in **node js environment**, so don't modify the function until you read the error, and only modify the part that the error announced accordingly, then use debugger for a better understanding of the issues !

//IhaveSomeIssues is a function that is supposed to get an array of strings and return the strings concatenated as an output

//Still this function has some issue

//use this function inside this file and run it with the terminal command to invoke the node debugger that will help you solve the issue

//! how to run a function in node environment

//* ALWAYS CHECK THE PATH OF THE TERMINAL ACCORDINGLY JUST TO BE SURE ABOUT YOUR CURRENT LOCATION

//? step 1 : use the command -> node [path-to-this-file]

//? step 2 : read the errors and try to correct them

//? step 3 : repeat step 1 and step2 until you solve the errors and get the result needed
